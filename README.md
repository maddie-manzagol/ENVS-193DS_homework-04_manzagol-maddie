# General Information 
The data set used in for this project is comprised of data regarding fish located in the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to present day. The parameters of the data set include species-level identification, lengths of each individual fish, and samples from a subset of both weight and scale. Samples were taken once annually from a 11 different sites. 

# Data and File overview 
This is the README which outlines information about the project and metadata for the files included within the project "ENVS-193DS_homework-04_manzagol-maddie"

The file "code" contains the quarto markdown document which will contain all code used to produce statistical analysis for the question "How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)?"

The file "data" contains the raw data set regarding fish samples from the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to the current day which will be read in and manipulated to to answer the statistical question we are asking: "How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)?"

# Methodological Information
Data was collected annually to track the fish assemblages of eleven primary lakes. Sampling was done at differnet littoral zone sites at each lake with traps, nets, and a boat mounted electrofishing system. Veritically hung gill nets are used to obtain samples from the deepest point per lake. Trammel net samples were used across the thermocline at two sites. The parameters include species-level identification, lengths of each individual fish, and samples from a subset of both weight and scale.
